<br/>
Jane received her BS (with honors) in Biological Sciences and her MS in Computer Science from the University of Chicago in 2014 and 2017 respectively. She is currently working as a TA in the CS department for Introduction to Python Programming and Bioinformatics.

As a capstone to her Computer Science degree, she completed a practicum project that sought to apply various machine learning algorithms to a Parkinson's Disease dataset and has since begun an independent study on various machine learning tools and their applications to the biological sciences. She hopes to pursue research in that field.

She is proficient in Python, including using Pandas, Scikit Learn, and building websites with Google App Engine, as well as having experience with Java, SQL, Swift, and R.

In her spare time, she enjoys crosswords (particularly NY and LA times), cooking ever spicier food for her family, carping about inaccurate scientific journalism, and playing with her dog Chloe (a.k.a. the Shewolf of Hades).
